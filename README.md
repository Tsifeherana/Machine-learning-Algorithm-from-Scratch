# Machine-learning-Algorithm-from-Scratch
## About

This project is a personal initiative to deepen my understanding of key Machine Learning algorithms by reimplementing them from scratch, without using high-level libraries.

The goal is to:
- Reinforce theoretical knowledge through practical coding.
- Explore how common algorithms work under the hood.
- Build a solid foundation for advanced ML and Deep Learning.

## Algorithms Implemented

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees
- Naive Bayes
- K-Means Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
(â€¦soon)
